## Austerity's affect on child welfare spending, and child mobility

Although education was protected from austerity measures, welfare was not. Since the beginning of austerity welfare has taken some of the biggest hits. These cuts hit the most socioeconomically deprived in Britain. This matters to child mobility because this is the basic start we give all of our children in Britain. If we cannot level the playing field, or provide enough money for families to support children, children will suffer and continue to live in poverty. 
 
Historically, child benefit is the universal payment for parents or guardians bringing up children, but since 2013, means tested as part of austerity measures,  via the ‘high income child benefit charge’. It removed eligibility for child benefit from families with at least one parent earning more than £60,000 and reduced awards for those with one earning between £50,000 and £60,000. 
 
As part of 2015’s Welfare Cap, the child element was limited to two children, the family element in tax credits was removed, and universal credit and housing benefit were limited, which is estimated to save £1.6 billion in 2019-2020.

In 2016 -2017 spending on child benefit was 5% of the total welfare budget, around £12 billion. Spending has risen in cash terms, but has fallen relative to national income over the past 30 years. Before austerity, it was generally uprated inline with inflation - but in this period, prices were rising less quickly than average earnings and national income - the decline was offset by the occasional policy decision to increase spending.
 
Alongside recent decisions to freeze the uprating of child benefit until 2018, uprating with CPI in later years means that spending on child benefit is forecast to fall as a share of national income through to 2022-23.
 
## The welfare cap
 
In 2014, the Government set a cap on the total amount forecast to be spent on selected benefits and tax credits from 2015-2016. It’s separate to the ‘benefit cap’ which limits the overall welfare payments to families.  The government protected pensions - because of its complexity - and jobseeker’s allowance - because it's “the most cyclical elements of welfare.” - leaving half of welfare subject to the cap.

The cap was reset in the July 2015 Budget and we made a formal assessment of performance against it in the November 2016 Autumn Statement, which showed it being breached in all years. The Government then introduced a new welfare cap, which was set to only apply in 2021-22. This cap was re-set in November 2017 following the beginning of a new Parliament, with the latest cap applying to spending in 2022-23. This is the dotted figure.

The division of the total personal tax credit bill between child and working tax credit assumes the tapering of tax credit entitlement reduces working tax credit before child tax credit. This is consistent with HMRC practice.
